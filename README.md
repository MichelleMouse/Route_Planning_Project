# Route_Planning_Project
Welcome to the first project of C++ Nanodegree!

In this project, I created a route planner that plots a path between two points on a map using real map data from the [OpenStreeMap project](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/-28.153/133.275) based on the A* search algorithm.
